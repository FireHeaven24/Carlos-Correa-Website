        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          I am a <em>computer engineer</em> proficient in many programming
          lanugages like C++, Python, SQL, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. WIth a wide
          variety of skills, I implement my skills and passion to my work and my
          personal life. I have a loving girlfriend Ace, live with my parents, I
          have a dog, and I love to paint warhammer minis and play funny boat
          games. Everything I do I do because I have a passion for the work I
          do.
        </p>

        <h3>Creative Beginnings</h3>
        <p>
          When I was young, I displayed a passion for creative arts. My passions
          growing up was drawing, painting, sketching, and designing. This is
          still true about me to this day. I enjoy painting tabletop miniatures
          and painting on large canvases.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I grew up and moved into college and graduating from St. Brendan
          High School, I took up engineering as a career path to allow me to be
          creative with technical skills and make different projects and
          programs. In time I would learn to make and create robotics, websites,
          and eventually video games. I have a deep desire to continue my
          creative goals and use technology and my imagination to make that
          happen.
        </p>

        <!-- <h3>What career path I chose and why</h3>
        <p>
          I chose computer engineering after changing from my initial major
          which was mechanical engineering. The reason I made the switch was
          because of how insanely difficult it was to pass certain classes. On
          top of that, it became clear that what I would be doing with
          mechanical engineering was look at diagrams and plots all day long
          which is not what I can see myself doing. I made the switch when I
          realized how much more hands-on and more creativity programming can
          offer. It also offered me the technical skills to eventually make my
          own video game using game engines like Unity and Game Maker Studio.
